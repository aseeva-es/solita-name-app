# Solita dev-academy-2021 exercise solution (Name Application)

My solution is a web application. I used React, because I have a litle bit of experience with it in my hobby projects. 

User interface meets all requirements:
1. Lists names and amounts, most popular first. 
2. Click column titles to sort list of names in alphabetical or popularity order. Arrows show the sorting direction (accending or descending).
3. The total amount of all names is showed always on top.
4. The amount for a specific name(s) can be found by using the filter field.

I import names from a local json file, but I understand that in real-world situation it might need to be loaded from remote url. 

Solution features fully responsive, mobile friendly design with css @media query, and also the BEM methodology for naming css selectors.
